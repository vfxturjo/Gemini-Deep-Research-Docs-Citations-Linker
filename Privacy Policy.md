**Effective Date:** July 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Gemini-Deep-Research-Docs-Citations-Linker" Google Workspace Add-on (the "Add-on") handles information.

**1. Data We Access**

The Add-on needs permission to access and read the content of your currently active Google Document. This is necessary for its core function, which is to find citation numbers and the "Works Cited" section within the document.

**2. How We Use Your Data**

Your document's content is processed in real-time and is **never** stored, saved, or transmitted to any external server or third-party service. All processing happens locally within your own Google account and browser session. The Add-on uses the read information for the sole purpose of:

*   Identifying citation numbers (e.g., ¹, ²) in the text.
*   Parsing the "Works Cited" section to find corresponding URLs.
*   Modifying the document to insert hyperlinks and change text formatting (e.g., creating `[1]`).

**3. Data Storage and Sharing**

This Add-on **does not store or share any of your data**. No document content, personal information, or usage data is ever logged or sent to the developer or any other service.

**4. Contact**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer at: `vfxturjoapps2@gmail.com`
